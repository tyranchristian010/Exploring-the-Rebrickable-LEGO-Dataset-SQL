# Exploring-the-Rebrickable-LEGO-Dataset-SQL
In this project, we examine the data model of the Rebrickable LEGO Dataset and established a database for analytical purposes. We demonstrated how to answer data-related questions using SQL. The project covered a range of SQL-related topics, including basic queries, advanced techniques such as JOINS, CTEs, and WINDOW functions.
