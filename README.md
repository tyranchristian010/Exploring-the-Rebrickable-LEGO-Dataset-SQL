# Exploring-the-Rebrickable-LEGO-Dataset-SQL
The LEGO Rebrickable dataset was also analyzed through the use of SQL queries, including the application of advanced techniques such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), joins, and window functions. The aim was to gain insights into the parts, themes, and sets produced by LEGO since its inception. This project also involved the creation of a database using SQL and the import of files into the database through SSIS, thereby enhancing database and data import skills.
